# Practical FP in Scala

This is code to go along with the book [Practical FP in Scala](https://leanpub.com/pfp-scala) by Gabriel Volpe.

## Repo Structure

The repo is split into two separate projects:

- [example](examples/): Contains random code samples and experiments from the book
- [shopping-cart](shopping-cart/): Contains code for the project that is developed through the book. This has its own [README](shopping-cart/README.md) which describes (or will describe) what the project is and how to run it.

## Branch Structure

There's a scala2 and a (less complete) scala3 branch. The main branch is scala 2 which is what is used in the book.

## Disclaimer

Do not assume anything here is "correct" or even working
