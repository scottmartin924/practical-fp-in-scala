# Practical FP in Scala

This is code to go along with the book (Practical FP in Scala)[https://leanpub.com/pfp-scala] by Gabriel Volpe. The only real difference is this repo uses Scala 3 and some newer versions of dependencies.

## Repo Structure

The repo is split into two separate projects:

- _example_: Contains random code samples and experiments from the book
- _shopping-cart_: Contains code for the project that is developed through the book. This _should_ have its own README which describes what the project is and how to run it.

## Disclaimer

Do not assume anything here is "correct" or even working
